# ContestDigitalSkills

A web page can be viewed here: [Link](https://cyoq.github.io/ContestDigitalSkills/)

A work for the contest where I have created a web page which describes the work of the Virtual Reality creator. 

 A Unity engine with the wooden model of the castle of Dinaburg is inserted in the web page, therefore there is a possibility for an interactive walk.
